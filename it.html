        <h1> Bob Marley</h1>
        <h3 class="subHeader">Early Life </h3>
        <p class="paraGraph">Bob Marley was born on February 6th, 1945. He was born on a farm in Jamaica owned by his grandfather on his mothers side. His parents were Noval Marley and Cedella Booker. In his early life, his family lived in poverty. His father left his mother soon after he was born and died when Bob was ohnly 10 years old. When Bob lived in YTrench Town, him and his mother were exposed to violence, malnourshiment, disease and open sewers. Although this living situation was not ideal, he was able to draw inspiration from this and started creating music. He dropped out of school at the age of 14 in order to begin pursuing his dream of a music career and by the age of 16, he started producing his first records. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeader">Musical Career</h3>
        <p class="paraGraph">In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of Coffee", "Do You Still Love Me?" and "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie Kong.[40] Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee" being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.[41]</p>
        <h3 class="subHeader">Ilness & Death</h3>
        <p class="paraGraph">n July 1977, marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would hace hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.
